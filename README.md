# RayTracer_GroundUp
Implementation of a ray tracer from scratch following the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by Jamis Buck. For the moment this project is for learning purposes, so it is not optimized. 


This first scene I got from the ray tracer depicted the only geometry I was able to compute at first: Spheres and Planes.

The use of patterns allows for a better understanding on the geometry of the objects. I did not use an UV map to wrap patterns on the geometry.

The floor has a reflective attribute and the middle sphere has the refractive index of glass.
